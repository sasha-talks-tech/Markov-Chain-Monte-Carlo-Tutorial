# Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Tutorial

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook tutorial introducing **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** methods.  
The notebook combines theoretical explanations, Python implementations, and visualizations to illustrate the mathematical foundations and practical applications of Monte Carlo and Markov Chain techniques.

The goal is to make MCMC concepts more accessible by weaving together **mathematical intuition**, **real-world inspired scenarios**, and **reproducible code examples**.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

## Alternative Formats for Offline Viewing

In addition to the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), this repository includes:

- **HTML version**: A fully rendered version of the notebook that can be opened in any modern web browser.  
- **PDF version**: A static version of the notebook for easy reading, sharing, or printing.  

These formats are provided to make the tutorial accessible for readers who do not have a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook installed.  
The content, code, and visualizations remain the same as in the notebook, though interactive elements (such as widgets) will not be available in the static formats.

### Quick Start
If you want to **explore the tutorial immediately** without setting up Python, open either:

- `notebook.html` in your browser  
- or `notebook.pdf` in any PDF reader  

For the **full interactive experience**, we recommend running the Jupyter Notebook version locally.
